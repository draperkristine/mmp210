    		<p>in this midterm i wanted to do a quilt design with some words on it, i chose blue because it is a calming color like the sea and like the sky It is often associated with depth and stability. It symbolizes trust, loyalty, wisdom, confidence, intelligence, faith, truth, and heaven. Blue is considered beneficial to the mind and body.</p>
